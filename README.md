# Building a Remote MCP Server

This example allows you to deploy a remote MCP server on Cloudflare Workers. 

## Get started

[![Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/skwk/stocks-mcp)

This will deploy your MCP server to a URL like: `stocks-mcp.<your-account>.workers.dev/mcp`

## Connect to Cloudflare AI Playground

You can connect to your MCP server from the Cloudflare AI Playground, which is a remote MCP client:

1. Go to https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/
2. Enter your deployed MCP server URL (`stocks-mcp.<your-account>.workers.dev/mcp`)
3. You can now use your MCP tools directly from the playground!
